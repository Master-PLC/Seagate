This is a description for the data sets

There are 5 npy files, 3 of them are input files for train/val/test, and rest 2 are output labels for train/val. 
The output labels are hidden, and the final score is calculated based on the average ROC-AUC calculated based on the hidden labels and your predictions

Input structure: the inputs are three dimensional data with structure [sample, time-step, feature]. 
Each sample is mapped to a row in the output labels
There are two kinds of features, float and integer, and the last feature is padding indicator (if the value is 1, this time-step is a padding)
Float features are scaled numerical features (column 727-815), and integer features are one-hot encoded categorical features (column 0-726)
The time-series are very short, you can manipulate it as you wish for the final prediction

Output structure: the output labels are two dimensional data with structure [sample, label]
The output contains several binary classification tasks, each task has two columns, eg. [task_0_negative, task_0_positive, task_1_negative, task_1_positive...]
For each pair of the columns, the values could be positive (0,1), negative (1,0), and missing (0,0)
